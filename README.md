#### Task 1: Password Generator

1. **Objective:** Build a Password Generator application using Python.
2. **Description:** Developed a robust Password Generator that generates secure and unique passwords. Users input their name and preferred password length, and the generator intelligently combines letters, digits, and special symbols to create highly secure passwords.
3. **Key Features:**
   - Customizable password length.
   - Utilizes Python's `secrets` library for enhanced security.
   - Provides an option to reset or exit the generator.
4. **Implementation:** Used the `string` module to define character sets, and the `secrets` library to randomly select characters based on user input.

#### Task 2: Arithmetic Calculator

1. **Objective:** Create an Arithmetic Calculator application using Python.
2. **Description:** Designed an intelligent calculator that performs basic mathematical operations. Users can choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, ensuring accurate and precise results even for complex calculations.
3. **Key Features:**
   - Supports various arithmetic operations.
   - Handles division by zero scenarios.
   - User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
4. **Implementation:** Utilized functions for each operation and took user input for operands and operation choice.

#### Task 3: To-Do List Application

1. **Objective:** Develop a To-Do List application using Python.
2. **Description:** Crafted an intuitive and efficient task management tool. Users can add, remove, and view tasks in a structured manner. The application promotes organization and productivity by providing a clear overview of pending tasks.
3. **Key Features:**
   - Append and remove tasks with ease.
   - Display tasks added till the current session.
   - Simple and user-friendly interface.
4. **Implementation:** Created a `ToDo_List` class with methods to manage tasks, and a user-friendly menu for interaction.

These tasks collectively demonstrate practical Python programming skills and showcase the ability to build functional and user-friendly applications. The code for each task is well-structured, utilizing libraries and Python's built-in features effectively.

#### Task 1: Movie Recommendation System

1. **Objective:** Create a Movie Recommendation System using Python to provide personalized movie suggestions to users.
2. **Description:** Developed an interactive recommendation system that utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity techniques to suggest movies based on users' preferences. The system takes movie titles and corresponding genres, converting them into a numerical matrix. Cosine similarity is then calculated to offer similar movie recommendations to users.
3. **Key Features:**
   - TF-IDF vectorization for textual data transformation.
   - Cosine similarity calculation for accurate movie recommendations.
   - User-friendly interface for input and output.
4. **Implementation:** Utilized the `TfidfVectorizer` and `linear_kernel` functions from the `sklearn` library to process and analyze movie data.

#### Task 2: Interactive ChatBot

1. **Objective:** Develop an Interactive ChatBot using Python that engages users in dynamic conversations.
2. **Description:** Created an interactive ChatBot that employs rule-based responses to answer user queries and engage in conversations. Using if-else statements and pattern matching, the ChatBot responds intelligently to a variety of user inputs, from jokes to information requests. This project offers a practical introduction to natural language processing and conversation design.
3. **Key Features:**
   - Rule-based response system.
   - User input analysis using if-else statements.
   - Engages in informative and entertaining conversations.
4. **Implementation:** Designed a chatbot script with predefined response rules for different user inputs.

#### Task 3: Tic-Tac-Toe AI

1. **Objective:** Build an AI-driven Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python that offers a challenging opponent.
2. **Description:** Designed an AI agent for the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using the Minimax algorithm, with the option of integrating Alpha-Beta Pruning for enhanced efficiency. The AI player makes strategic moves to maximize its chances of winning or forcing a draw. This project provides insights into game theory, search algorithms, and decision-making.
3. **Key Features:**
   - AI-driven opponent with Minimax algorithm.
   - Option for Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize performance.
   - Interactive gameplay against the AI.
4. **Implementation:** Implemented the Minimax algorithm for AI decision-making and integrated it into a Tic-Tac-Toe game scenario.

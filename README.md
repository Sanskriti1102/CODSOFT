### 1. Python Programming Tasks:
#### Task 1: Password Generator

1. **Objective:** Build a Password Generator application using Python.
2. **Description:** Developed a robust Password Generator that generates secure and unique passwords. Users input their name and preferred password length, and the generator intelligently combines letters, digits, and special symbols to create highly secure passwords.
3. **Key Features:**
   - Customizable password length.
   - Utilizes Python's `secrets` library for enhanced security.
   - Provides an option to reset or exit the generator.
4. **Implementation:** Used the `string` module to define character sets, and the `secrets` library to randomly select characters based on user input.

#### Task 2: Arithmetic Calculator

1. **Objective:** Create an Arithmetic Calculator application using Python.
2. **Description:** Designed an intelligent calculator that performs basic mathematical operations. Users can choose from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, ensuring accurate and precise results even for complex calculations.
3. **Key Features:**
   - Supports various arithmetic operations.
   - Handles division by zero scenarios.
   - User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
4. **Implementation:** Utilized functions for each operation and took user input for operands and operation choice.

#### Task 3: To-Do List Application

1. **Objective:** Develop a To-Do List application using Python.
2. **Description:** Crafted an intuitive and efficient task management tool. Users can add, remove, and view tasks in a structured manner. The application promotes organization and productivity by providing a clear overview of pending tasks.
3. **Key Features:**
   - Append and remove tasks with ease.
   - Display tasks added till the current session.
   - Simple and user-friendly interface.
4. **Implementation:** Created a `ToDo_List` class with methods to manage tasks, and a user-friendly menu for interaction.

These tasks collectively demonstrate practical Python programming skills and showcase the ability to build functional and user-friendly applications. The code for each task is well-structured, utilizing libraries and Python's built-in features effectively.
